This comprehensive project involved the end-to-end development of an IoT-based system for real-time environmental monitoring. My contributions were central to bringing the hardware and software components together, culminating in a functional data acquisition and transmission system. **Due to the confidential nature of company projects, this description focuses on my specific technical contributions and the skills I honed, rather than proprietary project details or internal data.**

üß∞**Tools and Equipment**
1. Eagle
2. Arduino
3. USB
4. Solder

üñ•Ô∏è**DESCRIPTIONS**

‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design**
I did the detailed design and layout of a custom PCB for IoT sensors using Eagle software. This task required a strong understanding of electronic circuit principles, component datasheets, and best practices for PCB routing to ensure signal integrity and compact form factor.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Hardware Assembly, Testing, and Firmware Development**
Writing efficient C++ code for microcontrollers (Arduino), handling interrupts, and managing peripherals. In this section, I implemented communication protocols, I2C, to interface with the sensors. The communication modules that were configured and utilized were Wi-Fi for reliable data transmission. To indentify and resolve issues at both hardware and firmware, I did debug and Troubleshoot.
