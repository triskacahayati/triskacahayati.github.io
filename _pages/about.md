I am a driven final-year Master's student at Bandung Institute of Technology, pursuing Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Telecommunications. My comprehensive academic background has equipped me with a solid understanding of wireless communication systems, network system development, and advanced concepts such as AI, ML, and IoT.

My ongoing Master's Thesis, expected to conclude in July 2025, centers on Deep Reinforcement Learning for energy-efficient CF Massive MIMO. 
Furthermore, my bachelor's thesis involved designing an Antenna System for Satellite 5G Convergence, which led to a published paper and presentation at an international conference [publications](https://triskacahayati.github.io/publications/).
